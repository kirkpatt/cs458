\section*{Introduction} %for journal use above \firstsection{..} instead
Cybersecurity is a serious concern, or at least should be, for almost every industry.
In the modern world relies heavily on computers of all forms, for basic tasks like checking the weather to heavy industrial computation.
The data stored and processed by these systems can be very valuable and targeted for theft.
Because of this there has been an ever-growing list of malware used to break into computer systems and gain whatever the attacker was looking for.
Today, with nearly 40 years of enterprise computer usage, there is a lot of data available on the exploits, but it can be very technical and hard to sift through. 
With information visualization we can do a better job on analyzing these trends, which allows the creation of better defenses against future attacks.

\section{Visualization Tasks}
The question we are trying to answer is what industries are most vulnerable to cyber attacks and what types of attacks are most prevalent. 
This problem is important because it provides a way for cybersecurity companies to see which industries are most in need of their services. 
It also allows industries that are most affected by cyber attacks to see which types of threats they are most vulnerable to.

\section{Data Sources}
There are plenty of security companies that disclose information about cyber attacks. 
Popular cyber security companies such as Symantec, McAfee, Malwarebytes publish monthly and yearly threat reports about different kinds of attacks. 
Symantec organizes the monthly threat report into five different categories: Malware, Web Attacks, Spam, Phishing, Mobile, and Social Media. 
They also give information about the number of threats per industry. \cite{SMR}
Malwarebytes publishes a state of malware report every year which contains information on the most common types of attacks with a focus on ransomware trends in particular. 
They give trends of different threats over the last three years, which provides a more thorough data set. \cite{MWB}
In the McAfee report, the volume of malicious samples cataloged per quarter ebbs and flows quarterly and annually. 
This data showed a decline during the past three quarters which mirrored the trend we observed at the start of 2015. 
A pattern of two to three quarters of growth followed by three quarters of decline has been consistent since 2013. \cite{QT17}

\section{Design Comparison}
There were many iterations of design ideas that went into this visualization page, ranging from grand scheme design choices to small implementation tweaks.
This basic framework stayed throughout the process, but the design of it evolved over time. 
A scroll bar for different months of data was one of the big things that was added, as well as a pie chart breaking down the data within each category upon clicking on one.
Each of the industries has their own section, and these all contain data about which types of attacks are most prevalent.

A number of arrangement ideas for the data were compared, with the look eventually settling on one of differently sized and colored blocks.
These help to display the distribution difference both with color and size, so that someone with some form of visual impairment is likely to still be able to tell the difference.
There was much discussion over the use of a red to green scale, since a number of colorblind people may be affected, but it made the most sense for our data, and the size difference help to provide a backup for this.

\section{Implementation}
We will implement the ER diagram by putting the data from Symantec into a mySQL database that is hosted by OSU using PHP.
We will have two tables, one that contains industries and the total number of attacks, along with threat IDâ€™s that correspond to a type of threat, the number of attacks, and the date associated with the report. 
We can compare this data by looking at different sectors and how they vary by the attacks that are most common.

\section{ER Diagram}
The diagram for this project can be seen in Figure 1.
\begin{figure}[tb]
 \centering % avoid the use of \begin{center}...\end{center} and use \centering instead (more compact)
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{erdigram}
 \caption{Layout of how different sources are related}
 \label{fig:sample}
\end{figure}

\section{Design Ideas}
\begin{figure}[tb]
 \centering % avoid the use of \begin{center}...\end{center} and use \centering instead (more compact)
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Design1}
 \caption{Representation of attacks within different industries, utilizing color and size to represent the data visually}
 \label{fig:sample}
\end{figure}

This is the main part of the design, which can be seen in Figure 2. 
Each square represents an industry, labeled below it. 
The squares get larger and shift from green to yellow to red the more prevalent cyber attacks are in an industry. 
At a glance it is easy to tell which industry has the biggest problem with cyber attacks. 
Each box is labeled below, and inside the box is the total number of attacks per month (this is not real data). 
Something we put a lot of thought into while designing is the possibility of colorblind users, as they are quite common. 
In this part of the design, and in the rest, it should be noted that the design does not rely on color, and has an alternative way of conveying this information.

When hovering over any box with oneâ€™s mouse, say, the Agriculture box:
\begin{figure}[tb]
 \centering % avoid the use of \begin{center}...\end{center} and use \centering instead (more compact)
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Design2}
 \caption{Provides a breakdown of the prevalence of specific attack types within an industry}
 \label{fig:sample}
\end{figure}
You can see in Figure 3 that a pie chart has appeared above the square, with slices colored and sized based on cyber attack type. 
This shows the user a breakdown of not only what industry is subjected to attacks, but the distribution of attacks as well.
You might note the small size of the light green slice, and how there is only a number, not a label inside it. 
The is because the name cannot fit in the slice. 
The last part of the design can be seen by hovering over a slice to learn more about it.

For example, hovering over the small green slice: 
\begin{figure}[tb]
 \centering % avoid the use of \begin{center}...\end{center} and use \centering instead (more compact)
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Design3}
 \caption{A further breakdown, providing source details for each attack type}
 \label{fig:sample}
\end{figure}
This tab in figure 4 shows the detailed information we have about the attack, such as its name, the id we assign it, the occurrences per month (displayed on the slice) the total occurrences, and recent reports of the attack. 
This is a bit of a wall of text, but there isnâ€™t much more we can do there, as this is detailed information that does not translate as well into a fancy graphic. 
This tab always opens to the right, to avoid running into taller industry squares.

\section{Conclusion}
This topic has a wide variety of data sources which can be combined and compared in interesting ways to draw a variety of conclusions.
With database manipulations and interesting front-end visualization this raw data can be made into something very interesting.
The better the visualization, the better users can understand the information and gain valuable security knowledge.
